# Seam Carving

This project was done as a class project for the following class:
Data Structures and Algorithms (INFO0902-1)

It is a C implementation of a seam carving algorithm, with dynamic programming.

The brute-force search method requires an exponential execution time. By using
programming, it is reduced to a linear execution time.
